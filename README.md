# Web Scraping Challenge
#### In this project, we will first use Jupyter Notebook to scrape various websites for data related to the Mission to Mars.
#### After completing the above Jupyter Notebook, we will create a Python/Flask application with MongoDB as the backend database to display all these observations in a single HTML page. 

## The website will have following sections:-
#### Latest Mars News - Collect and Display the latest News Title and Paragraph Text from Nasa.
#### Featured Mars Image - We will use splinter to navigate the site and find the image url for the current Featured Mars Image and display it on our website.
#### Mars Facts - We will scrape the Mars Facts webpage and use Pandas to scrape the table containing facts about the planet including Diameter, Mass, etc. and then convert the data to a HTML table string.
#### Mars Hemispheres - We will scrape USGS Astrogeology site to obtain high resolution images for each of Mar's hemispheres and display Hemisphere title and high resolution hemisphere image.

## Note
#### Screenshots of the final application is stored in a word document in the root folder of this repo.
